# InElegant â€“ a modified Elegant theme for Pelican

[Elegant] is a theme for the static site generator [Pelican].

InElegant is also a theme for the static site generator Pelican.
InElegant is based on Elegant, with some tweaks and fixes for my own
use.


## InElegant Pelican Container

This project produces a containerized version of Pelican with this
theme installed, for use in generating my own site. Feel free to use
it if you like it, but be warned that I might tweak things for my own
use cases.
