# InElegant â€“ a modified Elegant theme for Pelican

[Elegant] is a theme for the static site generator [Pelican].

InElegant is also a theme for the static site generator Pelican.
InElegant is based on Elegant, with some tweaks and fixes for my own
use.

pelican-inelegant is a container which bundles up the Pelican
tool, a selection of plugins, and the InElegant theme.


## Pelican Container

The container produced by this fork is my way of ensuring that
the site which builds today will also build tomorrow. It locks
into place a known-working version of the Pelican tool, plus
various plugins and supporting packages and my forked copy of
the Elegant theme.


## Differences from Elegant

I liked a lot of what Elegant had to offer, but there were a few
things that didn't quite fit with my existing site content as I was
porting from Octopress to Pelican. So of course I had to get in
there and change some stuff! InElegant is my messy attempt to 
turn Elegant into what I needed.


### Overall Git Layout

I dropped the documentation blog, and a number of dependency files.

I re-organized the js and css sources that were minified/squished
together to the final js and css so that only the results were
published.

I added a Makefile for setting up the relevant node deps and for
creating a local copy of the container. Gulp is left to only handle
the js/css steps,  though I'd like to eventually drop node entirely.


### Pages

I Added a Pages header for listing all of the static non-article
pages. I had a lot of them, and the only other option was including
every single one in the navigation bar.


### Basic CSS

There was some fighting over block types for anchors and images that I
found annoying. I also didn't like the floating underline being
produced as a transform/translate. So now images correctly clear and
can be wrapped around with the `float` attribute.

I also tweaked the footer to center the site title, and added a line
break between title and subtitle (since some of mine were way too long
when presented on a single line).

I injected a site content copyright declaration into the html meta header.


### Code blocks

I disliked the pygments theme that elegant went with, so I swapped
back to the pygments default theme. I also didn't particularly like the
Copy feature, so I ripped that out.
