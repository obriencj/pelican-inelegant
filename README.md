# InElegant â€“ a modified Elegant theme for Pelican

[Elegant] is a theme for the static site generator [Pelican].

InElegant is also a theme for the static site generator Pelican.
InElegant is based on Elegant, with some tweaks and fixes for my own
use.


## Differences from Elegant

So of course I had to get in there and change some stuff.


### Git Layout
I dropped the documentation blog, and a number of dependency files. I
have no intention of re-hosting the original elegant site as part of
this fork.

I re-organized the js and css sources that were minified/squished
together to the final js and css so that only the results were
published.

I added a Makefile for setting up the relevant node deps, using gulp
to do the js/css steps, and for creating a local copy of the
container.


### Pages
Added a Pages header for listing all of the static non-article
pages. I had a lot of them, and the only other option was including
every single one in the navigation bar.


### Basic CSS
There was some fighting over block types for anchors and images that I
found annoying. I also didn't like the floating underline being
produced as a transform/translate. So now images correctly clear and
can be wrapped around with the `float` attribute.


### Code blocks
I absolutely hated the theme that elegant went with, so I swapped back
to the pygments default theme. I also didn't particularly like the
Copy feature, so I ripped that out.


### InElegant Pelican Container

This fork produces a containerized version of Pelican with this
theme installed, for use in generating my own site. Feel free to use
it if you like it, but be warned that I might tweak things for my own
use cases.
